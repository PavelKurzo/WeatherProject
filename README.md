# WeatherProject
Hey, here is my weather project. I've created collectionView, where you can add cells with weather parameters using textfield(for city name) and plus button for adding. On each screen you can find info buttons for help :)
Also you can delete cells using swipe gesture(left or right). The functionality is not really big, but seems everything works good, without any mistakes. 
You can download and test it!
