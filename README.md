# WeatherProject
Hey, here is my weather project. I've created collectionView, where you can add cells with weather using textfield(for city name) and plus button for adding.
Also you can delete cells using swipe gesture(left or right). The functionality is not really big, but seems everything works good, without any mistakes. 
You can download and test it!
